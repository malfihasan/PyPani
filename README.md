## Overview

"PyPani" is a Python package that provides irrigation scheduling based on weather, soil, vegetation stage, and crop types. It can be incorporated with a real-time forecasting model with sufficient environmental information and can simplistically recommend irrigation requirements to farmers and small agriculture stakeholders. The module concept was originally proposed by an international group of research institutes [1] in a project named "[The STARS Project](https://www.stars-project.org/en/about-us/the-stars-project/)". Later, the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center (CIMMYT) Bangladesh extended the idea, leading to the development of this model for Python users.

## Features

- üå§Ô∏è **Weather Module**: Integrates observed and forecasted weather data. Supports daily weather data with a seven-day weather forecast. Requires daily maximum and minimum temperature (¬∞C) and rainfall (mm). Currently, it supports per year-based prediction with a planting date for a single growing season for a single crop.
- üå± **Management Module**: Defines soil type, moisture level input, and prior irrigation. Supports various depths of the aquifer through 'config' to facilitate the modeling operation.
- üìà **Calculation Module [GDU and PET Module]**: Calculates the aggregated growing degree day (GDU) values from planting and determines evapotranspiration based on the selected equation. Supports Penman‚ÄìMonteith Equation, Priestley‚ÄìTaylor, and Blainy-Criddle Equation.
- üíß **Recommendation Module**: Generates daily crop water use and provides next week's irrigation recommendations based on forecast data.
